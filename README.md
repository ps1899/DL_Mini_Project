2) Yogesh Sharma (ys5270)

# Goal
In this mini-project, we are tasked with coming up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 
image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has nomore than 5 million parameters.

## Results

| Type   |      Accuracy      |
