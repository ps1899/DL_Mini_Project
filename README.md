# DL_Mini_Project
ECE - GY 7123 Deep Learning Mini Project repository.
This project has been developed by:
1) Prateek Srivastava (ps4792)
2) Yogesh Sharma (ys5270)

# Goal
In this mini-project, we are tasked with coming up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 
image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has nomore than 5 million parameters.

## Overview


* `DL_mini_project_main.ipynb`: This file is used for developing and debugging our model. It results in final accuracy of `92.66%`.
* `Accuracy vs Epochs.png`: Training & Validation Accuracy vs No. of Epochs plot.
* `Loss vs Epochs.png`: Training & Validation Loss vs No. of Epochs plot.


## Results

| Type   |      Accuracy      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Training |  99.97% |
| Testing |    92.66%   |
