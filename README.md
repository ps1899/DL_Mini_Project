# Modified ResNet Architecture
In this project, we came up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the CIFAR-10 
image classification dataset, under the constraint that model should have no more than 5 million parameters.

## Overview

* `DL_mini_project_main.ipynb`: This file is used for developing and debugging our model. It results in final accuracy of `92.66%`.
* `Accuracy vs Epochs.png`: Training & Validation Accuracy vs No. of Epochs plot.
* `Loss vs Epochs.png`: Training & Validation Loss vs No. of Epochs plot.


## Results

| Type | Accuracy |
|--------|:--------:|
| Training | 99.97% |
| Testing | 92.66% |
